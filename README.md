# Vizz-Project
Vızz Project. An announcement app for Çankaya University Industrial Engineering Club.\n
This is the source code of my project. You can see the files in the master branch.
This app is developed on VS Code using Flutter(dart) on kotlin DSL. 
It is meant to be used as an easy announcement app for club members.
You can freely examine and download the project. Even change it to use it by yourself.
If you want to change and adapt for your own, you should change the firebase codes, app name and assets etc.
Features: Users can remotely see all the announcements made. Admins can publish announcement with images on it. 
It is using firebase as database for announcements but does not use storage feature so that the app is free to use for all times.
I developed an image algorithm in order to solve the Firebase storage issue. 
If you paste a google drive link with "anyone with the link" property; the app converts the link into an image.
